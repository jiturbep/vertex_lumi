To recover the MC Closure Test results from the 5th of May I need to rerun the pile up masking correction twice and the fake correction once in this order:

1. Modify the masking correction for MC so that the delta z distribution is calculated by reweighting all the delta z distributions per NGenInt with a poisson 
distribution of mean 5 and then fit it with a delta-z template. This is done by modifying both the files initializePuCorr.cxx and PileIupMaskingCorrection.cxx
(there should be sufficient comments to find all the the places that need to be change, most of what I need should be already there and need only uncomment out).
2. Run the masking correction to obtain pmask_cache.root
3. Change mu_max from 71 to 40 in initializeFakeCorrection.cxx and calculate the fake correction to obtain fakerates.root (this file should come out the same as the
one called "Recovered...from04052014".
4. Change back to the current version of the masking correction and run it again to get a new file pmask_cache.root
5. Run the closure test.
